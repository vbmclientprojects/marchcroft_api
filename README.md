## Introduction

The Marchcroft API serves as a robust backend solution for various applications. By leveraging AWS Lambda, it offers a highly available and cost-effective way to run your backend services without the need for managing servers. This project aims to simplify the integration of backend services for developers.

## Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: Built on AWS Lambda, allowing automatic scaling and reduced operational costs.
- **RESTful API**: Follows REST principles for easy interaction and integration.
- **Python-Based**: Utilizes Python for ease of development and maintenance.
- **Secure**: Implements best practices for security and data protection.
- **Easy to Deploy**: Streamlined deployment process using AWS services.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service that runs code in response to events.
- **AWS API Gateway**: Manages API requests and routes them to the appropriate Lambda functions.
- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the Lambda functions.
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database service for storing application data.
- **AWS IAM**: Manages permissions and access controls for AWS resources.

## API Endpoints

The Marchcroft API provides several endpoints for interacting with your application. Below are some key endpoints:

- **GET /items**: Retrieve a list of items.
- **POST /items**: Create a new item.
- **GET /items/{id}**: Retrieve a specific item by ID.
- **PUT /items/{id}**: Update an existing item by ID.
- **DELETE /items/{id}**: Delete an item by ID.

For detailed documentation on each endpoint, please refer to the [API Documentation](docs/api.md).

## Deployment

Deployment is straightforward with the provided scripts. The `deploy.sh` script handles the creation and configuration of necessary AWS resources. Ensure you have the required permissions in your AWS account to execute the deployment.
